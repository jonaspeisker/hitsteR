# hitsteR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

hitsteR is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package to make a song guessing game. Based on a Spotify playlist, they generate a pdf with artist, year, and song title on one side and a QR code to play the song on the other side.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hitsteR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jonaspeisker/hitsteR")
```

## Setup

Before beginning, create a Spotify playlist or select a public one that you want to turn into a game. The main goal of the game is to build a timeline of songs which makes it a fun way to discover new music (good or bad) and get a sense how styles evolved over time. The playlist can be a wild mix or focus on a particular genre but the years should span a long enough time period to be distinguishable from each other. As a rule of thumb, at least 50 years is recommended. 

Start by assigning your Spotify client ID and client secret to environment variables with `set_spotify_credentials()`. You can get them by going to the dashboard at [developer.spotify.com](https://developer.spotify.com/) and creating a new application. The credentials `my_spotify_client_id` and `my_spotify_client_secret` can be passed directly to the function or set in a different file, such as `.Renviron`.

```{r setup}
library(hitsteR)
source(".Renviron")
set_spotify_credentials(my_spotify_client_id, my_spotify_client_secret)
#> Spotify credentials successfully set.
```

## Get and clean tracks from Spotify API

The following example uses the playlist [Top 100 Greatest Songs of All Time](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6i2Qd6OpeRBAzxfscNXeWp?si=770c9e4eaee14574) (which actually contains 117 songs). `get_track_metadata()` takes only a [Spotify playlist ID](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids) as argument. 

```{r get-tracks}
my_track_metadata_raw <- get_track_metadata(playlist_id = "6i2Qd6OpeRBAzxfscNXeWp")
#> Got raw data on 117 tracks.
```

`clean_tracks()` tidies up the raw data returned by the API:

```{r clean-tracks}
my_track_metadata <- clean_track_metadata(my_track_metadata_raw)
#> Cleaned data on 117 tracks.
```

## Make card layout

Once the data is prepared, the pdf can be generated with `make_cards()`. 

```{r make-cards}
make_cards(tracks = my_tracks, color = TRUE)
```

## Prepare cards

- Print the pdf double-sided and mirrored on the long edge. For best results use heavy paper or laminate the pages.
- Cut pages along the marks.
- Enjoy!
